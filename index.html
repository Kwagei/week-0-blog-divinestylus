                 <h1>HOW TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT COLORS <br>FOR YOUR BRAND?</h1>
                <p><span><em>"Colors, like features follow the changes of emotions". </em></span>These were the words of Pablo Picasso, <br>
                    who is considered as one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. Color is a key driver of emotions <br>
                    and emotion is a key driver of action. As a business owner, it is a major concern that your customers <br>
                    take positive actions toward your brand.</p>

                <p>In order to drive such actions, they need to feel the right emotions which are largely influenced by your brand's color. <br>
                    Therefore, the issue of color picking shouldn't be something you do whenever you feel like it, because color has the <br>
                    potential to either make or break your business. In fact, <span><strong><a href="https://www.colorcom.com/research/why-color-matters">research shows</a></strong></span> that up to 85% of consumers think that color <br>
                    is an important factor for choosing products, while 93% said that they put most importance on the visual factors when <br>
                    purchasing products. Yes indeed, we do judge the book by its cover.</p>

                <p>Instead of choosing your brand's color based on what seems nice to you or your friends, we're going to walk <br>
                    through the strategic process ambitious brands use when choosing colors that enables them to stand <br>
                    out within their market.</p>

                <h2>HAVE CLEAR GOALS AND A PERSONALITY</h2>
                <p>Without a clear goal, you're definitely going to drift around in confusion. Ambitious brands with great color schemes <br>
                    never became that way by drifting.</p>

                <p>Toyota red is the main brand color of <span><strong><a href="https://www.toyota.com/">Toyota</a></strong></span>. Red is a color of energy, which we'll talk more about in this article.<br>
                    According to Toyota, it "is highly visible and conveys the Toyota spirit of excitement". Bright shades of red are highly <br>
                    recognizable and their goal is to create a sense of urgency when customers are viewing Toyota's cars. <br>
                    Is there any wonder why <span><strong><a href="https://www.coca-cola.com/">Coca-Cola</a></strong></span> also uses red?</p>

                <p>What are your brand's goals? What emotions do you want your audience to feel? Choosing your brand's color <br>
                    is easy if you know what you want to communicate. Think of your company as a person. Who are they? <br>
                    Are they serious or playful? Classic or modern? Affordable or Luxurious?</p>

                <p>Having a clear idea about what your brand's goals are and how you want your audience to feel will help <br>
                    you to choose colors that have a positive effect on your brand. </p>

                <h2>RESEARCH YOUR COMPETITION</h2>
                <p><span><strong><a href="https://web.facebook.com/">Facebook</a></strong></span>, <span><strong><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html">Intel</a></strong></span>, <span><strong><a href="https://www.barclays.co.uk/">Barclays</a></strong></span>, <span><strong><a href="https://www.chase.com/">Chase</a></strong></span>, and <span><strong><a href="https://online.citi.com/US/login.do">Citibank</a></strong></span>. What do all these companies have in common? First of all, <br>
                    they share similar industries. The first three are technological companies while the latter three are banks. <br>
                    More importantly, they all share the color blue. The color blue represents trust, it's no surprise that <br>
                    companies that hold a good amount of money and data(information) require immense trust from their customers.</p>

                <p>Researching the colors of business in your industry can help you decide if you want to stand out by choosing <br>
                    a different color, or match. However, you can still stand out in the same industry while sharing similar colors.</p>

                <h2>USE COLOR PSYCHOLOGY</h2>
                <p>Imagine having the magical powers of making people feel a certain way. That's what color psychology <br>
                    enables you to do. It helps you reflect on the emotions you want your customers to feel.</p>

                <p>This is where you choose colors that match your brand's goals and personality, while also <br>
                    keeping your competition in mind.</p>

                <h2>GATHER INSPIRATION AND CREATE A MOOD BOARD/font></h2>
                <p>Once you have completed the above three steps, it's time to get inspired. Since you know the colors that best <br>
                    represent your brand, try finding images and color schemes of those colors. Placing multiple colors together <br>
                    will give you an idea about the mood and vibe your brand will have.</p>
                <p>Once you get your mood board done, you can now build your color scheme. Pick three colors from there. <br>
                    First your base color, your accent color, and your neutral color. Your <span><strong>Base Color</strong></span> <br>
                    should reflect on your brand's major personality and also appeal to your target audience. <br>
                    The remaining colors will be chosen based on how well they match with the base color.</p>
                <p>Your <span><strong>Accent Color</strong></span> will be less dominant. This should not only match your brand's <br>
                    goal and personality but should also pair visually with your base color and appease your audience. The final color <br>
                    is your <span><strong>Neutral Color</strong></span>. This will most likely be your background color. It's not intended <br>
                    to draw attention. These include hues of gray, beige whites, and black.</p>
                <p>There are no strict rules in this process. However, use this article as a guide in helping you reach a highly <br>
                    fruitful destination. While these guidelines are tried and true, don't hesitate to use your gut feelings <br>
                    in the process. Once you are aware of the guidelines, then you can effectively color outside the lines. <span><strong>Be Creative</strong></span>.</p>
